# MOS---Phases

It is a Virtual Operating System developed using c++.

Phase 1 and 2: Batch operating System (performs one job at a time)
Phase 3: Efficient in performance, uses auxilary space (drum) to pass input program cards.


In phase1 we have came across only one interrupt i.e. SI.
In phase2 we came across a two different interrupts that are TI and PI and based upon their values we encountered 6 different errors in which we handeled one error i.e. valid page fault, and just printed all other errors in the output file.
In phase3 a new value of TI is introduced(TI == 1) which is Time Slice Out, and also we introduced three channels for simultaneous working.
